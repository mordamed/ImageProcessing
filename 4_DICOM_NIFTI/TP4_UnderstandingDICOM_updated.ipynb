    "### 1. Introduction to DICOM Files\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What is a DICOM File?\n",
    "[DICOM](https://www.dicomstandard.org/) (Digital Imaging and COmmunications in Medicine) is the de-facto standard that establishes rules that allow medical images (X-Ray, MRI, CT) and associated information to be exchanged between imaging equipment from different vendors, computers, and hospitals. It not only stores the image but also includes important metadata such as patient details, modality (e.g., CT, MRI), image orientation, pixel spacing, and much more. The DICOM format provides a suitable means that meets health information exchange (HIE) standards for transmission of health related data among facilities and HL7 standards which is the messaging standard that enables clinical applications to exchange data.\n",
    "\n",
    "DICOM files typically have a .dcm extension and provides a means of storing data in separate ‘tags’ such as patient information, image/pixel data, the machine used, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "For more information, refer to : https://www.dicomstandard.org/about-home\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Use Cases:\n",
    "- **DICOM** is heavily used in hospitals and clinics because it integrates with medical imaging equipment.\n",
    "- **Clinical Metadata**: DICOM files include vital information about the patient and imaging modality, which is essential for diagnosis and treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Structure of a DICOM File\n",
    "A typical DICOM file contains:\n",
    "- **Header**: Contains metadata such as patient ID, modality, and image acquisition details.\n",
    "- **Image Data**: The pixel data representing the actual image."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The following package supports working with DICOM files:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [pydicom](https://pydicom.github.io/) is a dedicated library for handling DICOM files, allowing access to both pixel data and the associated metadata (e.g., patient details, equipment information, scan parameters). pydicom is ideal when working in medical contexts where you need to inspect, modify, or extract specific information from the DICOM headers in addition to the image data. `pydicom` is best for comprehensive access to both image and metadata, useful when medical details are required for further analysis. It provides pixel data as a NumPy array via the pixel_array attribute, which can be processed and visualized easily. `pydicom` is commonly used with `numpy` and `matplotlib`. `numpy` provides a flexible and efficient structure (the NumPy array) to store and manipulate image data across all three libraries (imageio, pydicom, and scipy.ndimage) and `matplotlib.pyplot` is used to visualize the image data after it's loaded and processed, displaying it in an intuitive and customizable way.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with DICOM files, they may sometimes be compressed into a .zip archive. To handle this, we first need to unzip the files before reading them. This can be done easily using Python's `zipfile` module to unzip the DICOM file, or you can unzip the file using the GUI.\n",
    "\n",
    "To read the image, using the `pydicom` library use the `dcmread()` function, which gives you access to the pixel data via the pixel_array attribute."

    "\n",
    "The reason for such values, in comaprison to the traditional 0-255 range we deal with for standard image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.) is because these formats use 8-bit per channel color depth. These values represent the intensity of each pixel for grayscale images or the intensity of each color channel (red, green, blue) in color images.\n",
    "\n",
    "In medical images, particularly in formats like DICOM or NIfTI, pixel values represent more than just simple intensity. They often carry information about the tissue characteristics, physical properties (like density or radiodensity), or signal intensities from imaging machines like CT or MRI. These values are stored in floating-point or higher-bit integers to capture a wider dynamic range of intensities, which is essential for accurate diagnosis. \n",
    "\n",
    "MRI scanners store signal intensities using 12-bit or 16-bit depth, which means that pixel values can exceed the 255 range of standard images, allowing for much higher precision in intensity values. In this case, the maximum pixel value of 7017 is quite typical for high-resolution medical images, particularly in MRI.\n",
    "The full range of pixel values might not always be directly useful for visualization. In clinical practice, radiologists use windowing techniques to adjust the display of these pixel values to fit the display range (e.g., 0-255), highlighting specific tissues of interest. However, for data analysis, usually we work with the raw pixel values (like in an array), which preserve the full dynamic range of the MRI scan. \n",
    "\n",
    "The non-normalized image displayed perfectly suggests that the DICOM image already contains pixel values in an appropriate range for visualization. Commonly, DICOM files include fields like `RescaleSlope` and `RescaleIntercept`, which transform raw pixel values into a more meaningful range (e.g., Hounsfield units for CT scans). MRI scans often have pixel intensities that map to tissue types or structures in the body, so forcing them into a 0-255 range can remove useful information."

    "### Coding Project - Simple Brain Region Segmentation from DICOM Images\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will work only with the provided DICOM zip file.\n",
    "Your goal is to perform a simple segmentation of one region of the brain using basic image-processing tools.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are free to choose:\n",
    "\n",
    "* which slice to analyze,\n",
    "* which plane (axial, sagittal, or coronal),\n",
    "* which segmentation method to use\n",
    "  (intensity thresholding, histogram-based selection, filtering + threshold,watershed etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Tasks**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Load the DICOM images\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Inspect the metadata of at least one slice\n",
    "   (e.g., SliceLocation, ImageOrientationPatient, PixelSpacing, SliceThickness).\n",
    "   Use this information to briefly justify **why you selected a particular slice or plane** for segmentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Visualize the selected slice, and optionally plot its intensity histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Choose a simple segmentation strategy to isolate a meaningful brain region\n",
    "   (for example something resembling grey matter, white matter, or any visibly distinct structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Create a binary mask that isolates the region based on your chosen method.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Apply the mask to the slice and display the segmented region.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. (Optional but recommended) – Basic Image Quality Measurement\n",
    "\n",
    "To connect this project with the image-quality section of the lab, compute one of the following metrics on your chosen slice:\n",
    "\n",
    "- SNR (Signal-to-Noise Ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "- CNR (Contrast-to-Noise Ratio)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sharpness (e.g., Sobel gradient magnitude)\n",
    "\n",
    "- RMSE between the original slice and a filtered version (e.g., Gaussian)\n",
    "\n",
    "A very short explanation about what your chosen metric tells you about the image is enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Write a short comment discussing:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * what the segmentation isolates well,\n",
    "   * what it fails to isolate,\n",
    "   * the limitations of simple intensity-based methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "No advanced algorithms are required.\n",
    "The goal is to explore how basic DICOM information and pixel intensities can guide the segmentation of a brain region.\n"
